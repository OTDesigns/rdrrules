  <h1>Roleplay Rules</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Roleplaying as a nude character is not allowed.</li>
    <li>Players must change out of the GTA starter clothing into an outfit of their choice.</li>
    <li>Staff will ask you to go to a clothing store to change your clothing if needed.</li>

    <li>OOC channels (e.g., Discord) are not to be used to resolve in-character situations. 
        Do not provide in-game information or tactical details (meta-gaming). 
        Filing or threatening to file reports in OOC channels is not allowed.</li>

    <li>Do not argue in character inside our Discord channels. Save that energy for in-game. 
        Instagram-style channels are strictly for pictures and clips only. 
        Refusing staff warnings will result in a temporary mute.</li>

    <li>OOC is for out-of-character communication only. 
        Do not request in-character information in /OOC. 
        Questions about UI, mechanics, or graphics are allowed. 
        Complaining in /OOC will result in a warning.</li>

    <li>Do not call staff members’ phones regarding tickets, rulebreakers, missing weapons, etc. 
        If someone breaks a rule, open a ticket and provide video evidence. 
        For urgent issues, use /Report in game.</li>

    <li>If you bring or carry a downed player to LAS, allow any available EMS to handle treatment. 
        Do not bypass them.</li>
  </ul>
